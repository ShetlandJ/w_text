Their government talks the language of ethnic cleansing and I have met with our own medics out there who describe the most chilling and distressing scenes of calculated brutality against women and children.\n\nPolitically, a Commons vote will be engineered in September on recognition and we will lose it if we\u2019re not ahead of it. There are no circumstances in which people like me or Shabana could abstain or vote against, for example. Conference will be a sea of Palestinian flags and the moderates will be waving them.\n\nWe need to be leading the charge on this. The alternative is being dragged there with enormous damage to Keir, the govt and the party.\n\nI\u2019ve never been a shrinking violent on Israel. I\u2019ve supported LFI for over 20 years. Our sister party, Haaretz, and progressives are clear about what\u2019s being done in their name and they oppose it.\n\nI appreciate these things are always more complicated than they appear to those of us who aren\u2019t up close as you are and I also appreciate how much Keir and David are giving to this personally.\n\nBut it is what it is. We need to lead, not follow." },
  { d:"24 July 2025", s:"pm", t:"23:11", m:"I can see all this but I am worried that such a gesture now could blow a 2 SS out of the water if Israel decided that unilateral recognition justified further WB annexation which the US would be powerless to stop or reverse. That would be the end of it. So I think we need to employ practical means to get a 2SS, not quickly I grant but realistically. The PA with reform and new leadership can advance this with Arab/US/European support. The alternative is a further deadlocked death spiral on an even greater scale than now." },

I could not have wished for a better welcome by you all, a better introduction to the job or better support while here. Your professionalism has been superb, more so than I have experienced in any public role. For this I thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the announcement today are ones which I deeply regret. I continue to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein twenty years ago and the plight of his victims. I have no alternative to accepting the Prime Minister\u2019s decision and will leave a position in which I have been so incredibly honoured to serve.\n\nThe relationship between Britain and the United States of America is a unique one. I know that you will continue to serve and deepen that relationship from DC right across our brilliant network.\n\nI wish to thank you for all of your efforts in serving me as your Ambassador. In a short time we have achieved so much. We leave the relationship with the US in a really good condition, with a magnificent State Visit and the new US\u2011UK Technology Partnership \u2013 my personal pride and joy that will help write the next chapter of the special relationship \u2013 set for next week.\n\nThank you from me, Reinaldo and Jock. I will treasure the experience and memory of having worked with you all.\n\nVery best\n\nPeter\n\nLord Mandelson" },
