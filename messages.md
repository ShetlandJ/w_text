[31/08/2024, 12:19:30] Lord Mandelson: Different headline

[31/08/2024, 12:20:57] Wes Streeting: Better reflection of what you said

[01/09/2024, 21:33:47] Lord Mandelson: Would you consider speaking at the Oxford Union again in their no confidence in the government debate on October 17 (for Labour supporting President) ?

[01/09/2024, 21:34:24] Wes Streeting: Same day as my CLP AGM I'm afraid

[01/09/2024, 21:34:55] Lord Mandelson: That is the priority…..

[01/09/2024, 21:35:03] Wes Streeting: Yep!

27 December 2024

[27/12/2024, 15:37:27] Lord Mandelson: There is no touch of John Moore about you

[27/12/2024, 15:54:47] Wes Streeting: I had to google him!

[27/12/2024, 16:01:55] Wes Streeting: Not too bothered by it. It only confirms what I already know: delivery is the only thing that really matters and how I will now be judged.

[27/12/2024, 16:02:47] Lord Mandelson: Before Patrick's time too

[27/12/2024, 16:12:01] Wes Streeting: Indeed. Trying to work out which veteran has the wooden spoon out…

[27/12/2024, 16:23:40] Lord Mandelson: Could be anyone including the doorman

23 February 2025

[23/02/2025, 21:15] Wes Streeting: I spoke to Roger who suggested you are very much enjoying your new DC life! [US flag emoji]

Lord Mandelson: I am! It suits me...

By way we have a big problem coming down rack re pharma tariffs. Trump thinks US pharma not being treated well, wants to out tariffs on EU and UK and force manufacturing to US.

Wes Streeting: Urgh.

Wes Streeting: Yet RFK hates pharma.

[02/03/2025, 12:15:25] Wes Streeting: Am free all day, so call whenever you like

[02/03/2025, 12:16:35] Lord Mandelson: Great. Doing a morning show here and will call after

28 March 2025

[28/03/2025, 10:52:10] Wes Streeting: You should get Doyle to do your comms in DC!

[28/03/2025, 11:32:46] Lord Mandelson: All my comms have been shut down by No10.

Why was he pushed out ?

[28/03/2025, 11:32:53] Wes Streeting: God knows

[28/03/2025, 11:33:17] Lord Mandelson: The government problems do not stem from comms

[28/03/2025, 11:33:38] Wes Streeting: Quite.

[28/03/2025, 11:36:06] Wes Streeting: I fear we're in big trouble here - and I am toast at the next election. We just lost our safest ward in Redbridge (51% Muslim, Ilford S) to a Gaza independent. At this rate I don't think we'll hold either of the two Ilford seats.

[28/03/2025, 11:39:54] Wes Streeting: There isn't a clear answer to the question: why Labour?

[28/03/2025, 11:48:44] Lord Mandelson: The government doesn't have an economic philosophy which is then followed through in a programme of policies.

[28/03/2025, 11:49:15] Wes Streeting: No growth strategy at all

16 June 2025

[16/06/2025, 10:55:11] Wes Streeting: Morning! Are you free for a call anytime between 1400-1600 U.K. time as I've got a call with Secretary Kennedy today and I thought it worth a chat beforehand. This has just been sprung on me by my PO with a poor quality departmental briefing.

[16/06/2025, 11:27:49] Lord Mandelson: I am in Barrow on nuclear subs visit and I am not sure if I will have phones. Let me work out.

[16/06/2025, 13:24:12] Lord Mandelson: James Roscoe will contact you

29 June 2025

[29/06/2025, 09:33:59] Lord Mandelson: Well done on BBC, very good x

[29/06/2025, 19:58:27] Lord Mandelson: Are you planning visit to US this year ?

[29/06/2025, 20:01:57] Wes Streeting: Hope so! X

[29/06/2025, 20:02:33] Lord Mandelson: Need to plan. Lots of tech companies and people to talk to.

24 July 2025

[24/07/2025, 23:00:29] Wes Streeting: Am sure this will come up in coming days, so wanted to check in with you on recognition of Palestine and the domestic politics of it.

Keir's statement today was excellent, but Macron's statement tonight ups the ante.

Morally and politically, I think we need to join France.

Morally, because Israel is committing war crimes before our eyes. Their government talks the language of ethnic cleansing and I have met with our own medics out there who describe the most chilling and distressing scenes of calculated brutality against women and children.

Politically, a Commons vote will be engineered in September on recognition and we will lose it if we're not ahead of it. There are no circumstances in which people like me or Shabana could abstain or vote against, for example. Conference will be a sea of Palestinian flags and the moderates will be waving them.

We need to be leading the charge on this. The alternative is being dragged there with enormous damage to Keir, the govt and the party.

I've never been a shrinking violent on Israel. I've supported LFI for over 20 years. Our sister party, Haaretz, and progressives are clear about what's being done in their name and they oppose it.

I appreciate these things are always more complicated than they appear to those of us who aren't up close as you are and I also appreciate how much Keir and David are giving to this personally.

But it is what it is. We need to lead, not follow.

[24/07/2025, 23:11:47] Lord Mandelson: I can see all this but I am worried that such a gesture now could blow a 2 SS out of the water if Israel decided that unilateral recognition justified further WB annexation which the US would be powerless to stop or reverse. That would be the end of it. So I think we need to employ practical means to get a 2SS, not quickly I grant but realistically. The PA with reform and new leadership can advance this with Arab/US/European support. The alternative is a further deadlocked death spiral on an even greater scale than now.

[24/07/2025, 23:12:10] Wes Streeting: Israel is doing it anyway

[24/07/2025, 23:12:39] Wes Streeting: This is rogue state behaviour. Let them pay the price as pariahs with sanctions applied to the state, not just a few ministers.

[24/07/2025, 23:24:19] Lord Mandelson: Well, I don't make government policy I only help implement it so my views are between us.

[24/07/2025, 23:39:58] Wes Streeting: Absolutely. Not shooting the messenger. It's v helpful in trying to understand what Keir is weighing up as he balances all the risks and considerations that aren't necessarily obvious to the rest of us - so thank you!

26 July 2025

[26/07/2025, 13:06:26] Lord Mandelson: How are you feeling now ?

[26/07/2025, 13:32:44] Wes Streeting: Extremely concerned. Keir's statement has been received as boxing himself in. We are headed straight into:

- summer of angst

- ⁠SO24 debate and engineered vote on recognition in September

- ⁠if whipped, resignations at every level

- ⁠conference dominated by this

The discontent isn't just from the left of the PLP. It is from moderates.

Will be on a bigger scale than welfare and could prove fatal. ‎

[26/07/2025, 13:55:32] Lord Mandelson: If those events unfolded it would certainly convince the public that we are unfit for government.

What does the PLP think would follow from announcing recognition?

[26/07/2025, 13:56:06] Wes Streeting: Nothing in practice, but the symbolism matters against the backdrop of what we're seeeing.

[26/07/2025, 14:16:02] Lord Mandelson: Got it

3 September 2025

[03/09/2025, 22:52:09] Wes Streeting: I'd really like to meet Pete Buttigieg when he's in London for Global Progress. Do you think you could put us in touch?

[03/09/2025, 22:56:02]Lord Mandelson: I am sure. I will get office to reach him.

11 September 2025

[11/09/2025, 18:26:13] Lord Mandelson: LETTER TO BRITISH EMBASSY WASHINGTON STAFF FROM LORD MANDELSON

11 September 2025

Dear All,

As you will be have seen, my position as Ambassador to the United States has come to an end.

Being Ambassador here has been the privilege of my life, and Reinaldo's. I could not have wished for a better welcome by you all, a better

introduction to the job or better support while here. Your professionalism has been superb, more so than I have experienced in any public role. For this I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

The circumstances surrounding the announcement today are ones which I deeply regret. I continue to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein twenty years ago and the plight of his victims. I have no alternative to accepting the Prime Minister's decision and will leave a position in which I have been so incredibly honoured to serve.

The relationship between Britain and the United States of America is a unique one. I know that you will continue to serve and deepen that relationship from DC right across our brilliant network.

I wish to thank you for all of your efforts in serving me as your Ambassador. In a short time we have achieved so much. We leave the relationship with the US in a really good condition, with a magnificent State Visit and the new US-UK Technology Partnership - my personal pride and joy that will help write the next chapter of the special relationship - set for next week.

Thank you from me, Reinaldo and Jock. I will treasure the experience and memory of having worked with you all.

Very best

Peter

Lord Mandelson
